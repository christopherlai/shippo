# Shippo
Light wrapper around the Shippo[API](https://goshippo.com/docs/intro/).

[https://hexdocs.pm/shippo](https://hexdocs.pm/shippo)

## Installation
The package can be installed by adding `shippo` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:shippo, "~> 0.1.0"},
  {:hackney, "~> 1.15"}
  {:jason, "~> 1.2"}
  ]
end
```

## Configuration
`Shippo` can be configured in `config.exs`. The only configuration required is the Shippo token.

```elixir
config :shippo,
  token: "<shippo-token>"
```

Other options include:
* `url`
* `client`
* `client_opts`
* `json_library`

`Shippo.Client.Hackney` is the default HTTP client and `jason` is the default JSON library. Both are optional and can be replaced with your package of choice.

If youâ€™d like to use a different HTTP client, simply create a module that uses the `Shippo.Client` behaviour, and set your `client` configuration to the module.

```elixir
# shippo_client.ex

defmodule MyApp.ShippoClient do
  @behaviour Shippo.Client

  @impl true
  def request(method, url, headers, body, opts) do
  # your code here
  end
end


# config.exs

config :shippo,
  token: "<shippo-token>",
  client: MyApp.ShippoClient
```

## Usage
This package is a simple and lightweight wrapper around the Shippo API. API requests are made by constructing a `Operation` struct and then passing the operation to `Shippo.request/1`.

In the example below, `Shippo.Operation.Address.create/1` returns an `Operation` struct; this function does not produce network side effects. The `Operation` is executed by passing it to `Shippo.request/1`, this produces the network side effect and makes a HTTP call to the Shippo API.

```elixir
params = %{
  name: "Kris Shippo",
  street1: "123 Address",
  ctiy: "City",
  state: "CA",
  zip: "92000",
  country: "US"
}

params
|> Shippo.Operation.Address.create()
|> Shippo.request()
# {:ok, %{...}}
```

### Filtering
The Shippo API supports [filtering](https://goshippo.com/docs/filtering/) through query parameters. This functionality is support by passing a keyword list to function calls.

```elixir
operation = Shippo.Operation.Address.list(results: 1, object_created_gt: "2020-01-01")

Shippo.request(operation) # {:ok, %{...}}
```

### Pagination
Listing resources is paginated (a default of 5 objects are returned per the Shippo API documentation). If paginated, the response body will return a URL in the `next` and `previous` fields. These fields can be passed directly to `Shippo.request/1` to request the next or previous set of resources.

```elixir
operation = Shippo.Operation.Address.list(results: 1, object_created_gt: "2020-01-01")

{:ok, response} = Shippo.request(operation)
{:ok, response} = Shippo.request(response["next"])
{:ok, response} = Shippo.request(response["previous"])
```

## Testing
A combination of `mox` and `behaviours` are used for testing.

```elixir
# test_helper.exs
ExUnit.start()
Mox.defmock(MyApp.ShippoClient, for: Shippo.Client)

# my_app_test.exs
defmodule MyAppTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  import Mox
  setup :verify_on_exit!

  test "test usps" do
   expect(MyApp.ShippoClient, :request, fn _method, _url, _headers, _body, _opts ->
      {:ok, %{status_code: 200, headers: [], body:""}}
    end)

    assert {:ok, response} =
      "1234"
      |> Shippo.Operation.Address.get()
      |> Shippo.request()
  end
end

```
